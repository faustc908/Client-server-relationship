Ordering food at a restaurant is a good analogy for server client relationship.  You place an order to a waitress, it can be more then one thing.  The waitress (server) then process's the order and you don't see any of it happening.  The food just comes the way you wanted it. The server simply handles the request from the client.  The client specifies the order and receives the product of the order.
